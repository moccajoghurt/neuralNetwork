# slim Convolutional Neural Network (sCNN)

sCNN is a basic implementation of a convolutional neural network. The neural network offers the possibilty to create multiple network layers that are fully connected. The convolution offers 4 different matrix filter mechanics (you can easily add more) and uses wide convolution and max-pooling.
